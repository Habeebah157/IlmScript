It was not the strange country they interested the Marrowether Girls at the moment of their arrival, but an old friend. A tall boy was shaking hands vigorously with Judge Breckenridge, and Edid, stopping from the train at that instant, stood and stared in astonishment, hardly believing that she was seeing a right. Tommy Sharp, she cried, running to him with both hands outstretched. Why you've grown! You're almost as tall as I am! And what a grand cowboy's outfit! Tommy did not speak. He shook Edid's hand, but words so would not come. The boy's face was burned to a rich shade of brown. His eyes were bright, and the huskiness was gone from his voice. Health had come to him in this dry climate. Tommy looked as if he belonged there. He was tall, thin, and muscular, a desert dweller, not at all like the sickly boy that Edid had known and cared for on the camper's trail. In a moment, the boy was surrounded by the girls, and everybody was talking at once. It took some time for Tommy's embarrassment to wear off. Even Mrs. Patton was inclined to be shy with these friends of her daughter, but Mrs. Beckenridge, in her tactful way, soon put her at ease. Kit's mother was a born nurse, and one glant of the sick woman made her realize that she was needed. She helped to get the invalid into the car with the least possible jar. She arranged the pillows in a footstool in order to ease the bumps on the rough ground. See? She's deserted me already, laughed Kit as she watched her mother. I knew I wouldn't count when she saw Mrs. Beckenridge. Suddenly, there was a sort of warroop, and Billy Patton, who had hidden behind the station, dashed out at Kit, much to the amusement of Tommy Sharp. Why, you little imp, you haven't changed a single bit, Billy Patton. You're just as bad as ever to clear to sister. You're a pest. I am not. You're another, said the boy, and to Kit it seemed as if she had never been away from home. For the brother and sister had started again just where they had left off, half TC, half an earnest as their quarreling always was. Billy Patton was not bashful. Bold would have described his attitudes more than anything else. See this stick? He addressed Bet suddenly at the same time frowning defiantly as he caught Kit's eye. Of course I see the stick. What about it? laughed Bet Baxter. It's a humming stick that grows out here in Arizona. Isn't it wonderful? You just tap it gently like that and you can hear home. Kit made a gesture to interfere, but the judge smiled tolerantly and signaled the girl to keep quiet. Bet took the stick, which seemed like a hollow tube and tapped it gently on the ground. A strange buzzing started, continued for a few moments, then quieted, and Bet raised the stick once more. Billy put forth his hand to capture the rod, but before he could interfere, Bet had brought it out down with a thud on the ground. A wasp flew from the hole with an angry buzz and lighted fair and square on Billy's nose, burying its stingers deep into the flesh. The boy gave a howl, then choked back the tears. He was too much of a sport to make a fuss, especially as the joke was on him. The hollow stem was the insect's nest. Oh, I'm sorry Billy, please forgive me. pleaded Bet contriently. I didn't know there was a wasp inside that stick. I really thought it was a stranger's Arizona plant. Kit was chuckling. Never before had retribution come so quickly to her young brother, who delighted in playing tricks on a newcomer to the desert. But she only smiled at the boy. She wanted to say it serves you right. But she had only been back for ten minutes and decided that it was too soon to play the child. But Billy saw her gleam of triumph and decided he would go even with Kit at some later date. Let's get started girls. Everybody pile in, commanded the judge. You girls go in that car with Matt Larkin. I want Tommy Sharp with me. There wasn't a prouder boy in the whole world at that moment than Tommy. Judge Breckenridge wanted him, and maybe someday he would be his right hand man, as the judge playfully called him. To himself, Tommy promised that it would not be his own fault if he did not measure up to the judge's estimate of what a right hand man should be. That was amused to know that the slight swagger that Tommy assumed as he took his place beside his friend in the car. She exchanged a smile of understanding with Enid. The shower of sand hit the classics of the car as the driver started along the road. The girls gave a cry of alarm as they saw a jackrabbit that had been startled bound ahead of them for a few yards. Then, with a wild jump, it landed in the shelter of the sagebush. Doesn't everything smell so good? Shirley sniffed the air in long, in-drawn breaths. Didn't I tell you it was wonderful, said Kit? I used to get so lonesome just for a whiff of the desert, and your girls could never understand it. Of course we didn't understand. How could we? We'd never been here. That baxter's face was glowing with happiness. It was only ten o'clock, but already the sun was blazing hot. There was a fury about the heat, that the girls had never before experienced. They were glad to be under the shelter of the automobile top. Oh, Matt, called Kit, when they had to drive in a few miles, let's stop and get the girls some of those cactus fruits. They've never tasted them. Think of that. You don't say so. The driver smiled back at the eager young faces and brought his car to a stop. The girls jumped out, glad to get near to the strange plants of the desert. Suddenly, a rasping whir seemed to come from the ground at their feet. It was a sound to hold the nurse taut, to send the cold shivers up and down the spine. A rattler, exclaimed Kit delightedly. Now I do feel as if I were really home again. Where is it? I want a good look at my old friend, she added, as another insistent whir was heard. Matt Larkin had taken his automatic from his belt and pointed it, and in that instant the girls saw a black and yellow skin snake coiled, its head poised with darting tongue ready to strike. There was a menace in that coil. But the next minute, the heads had been neatly severed by a shot, and the long body writhed in squirms on the ground. Oh, cry bet, look at the pretty pattern on its skin. Pretty, sapped the man beside her, when you live in Arizona you can never see any beauty in a rattler. He just plain prison to everybody. There ought to be reward offered for every snake killed, then maybe they could be exterminated. The girls were glad to get back in the automobile again. Out of the glaring sun, each held a luscious cactus fruit gingerly in her fingers, trying to open it without getting the tiny prong spikes in their fingers. The driver climbed into his place and set the car going once more, headed toward the hills that seemed to be back in them. They had outdistance to the other car, for Judge Breckenridge was driving slowly for the sake of the invalid. When they saw the foothills ahead of them, Kit began to get excited. I've been up that road, she exclaimed, once down I went up to Jasper Crowe's claims to sell him a horse. But Shirley was staring ahead. Suddenly she cried. There's a lake, isn't it refreshing after so many miles of desert? I had no idea you had such large bodies of water in the country. The driver turned and glanced at Kit and spoke to Shirley. How far away do you reckon that lake is, miss? A mile, replied Bette decidedly. No, it's more than that, corrected Shirley. I remember reading Summer the distances in the desert are very deceiving. It's probably a lot further off than it seems. I'll say five miles. Let's hurry and get there so we can eat our lunch at the water's edge, suggested Joy. That's an idea, replied Matt with a sly glance at Kit. We'll try and get there by lunchtime. And look at the lovely trees, cried Joy. It's like an oasis in the desert, isn't it? But half an hour later they were no nearer the lake than they had first seen it. A haziness now hung over the water, partly hiding it, and the trees seemed to be floating in mid-air. That lake might be called Lake Illusion, laughed Bette. It certainly isn't real enough. Don't let us wait until we get there to eat lunch. I'm starved. After we've eaten we'll appreciate the view more, anyway. Even as they watched, the mistiness increased and they suddenly seemed to dissolve, leaving the desert stretching out before them hard, swollen, and cruel. The lake was gone. The waving trees were gone. Then the girls realized what they had witnessed, the mirage of the desert, the enticing promise of water that had been undoing of many a pioneer of the early days. A thoughtful expression came into the faces of the girls and their enthusiasm vanished for a few minutes. Stories of gone days came into their minds, stories of weary travelers who had been beckoned by the mirage, and taken miles out of their way by this false promise, perhaps to die of thirst. How hard life used to be for the pioneers, said Bette wistfully, and so easy for us. But why did the pioneers grow out on the desert, asked Joy lightly. They didn't have to do it, did they? Of course not, Joy, answered Bette, but they wanted adventure, and they were seeking another sort of mirage. It was the hope of gold and fortune in the hills. Bette gazed out over the vast stretch of messa, as if she was living through those early days herself, instead of being carried along by high-powered car that ate up the miles easily and swiftly. A low whistle from Bette brought the girls out of their daydreams to follow his glance ahead. Far along the sandy road was a man trudging along with a bundle over his shoulder. That ain't no desert man, said Bette quietly. How can you tell from here, asked Bette? You can always tell a desert man by his walk. That fellow looks as if you were used to walking on city streets. But he hasn't even a burrow, exclaimed Kit contemptuously. Let's give him a lift and see what he's doing so far from civilization. The man ahead had turned at the sound of the automobile, deposited his bundle on the ground, and stood waiting expectantly. The girl smiled as they greeted him. His clothes, a neat business suit, and light-collar shirt were soiled. His face was streaked with dust, but in his eyes there was that indefinable gleam that marks the soul of an adventurer. He was offered a lift. A very dusty, said the traveler. We don't mind at all, answered the girls. They liked the little man with his faraway look as if he belonged to another world, and were seeing sights that no one around him was seeing. Isn't he a dear, whispered Bette? I like him. Little did the girls dream that most of their summer adventures would center around this shabby figure, adventures they would thrill them, and at times, almost overcome them. If they had guessed it, they could not have been more cordial in their grieving and more eager to help him. Although none of them realized it, a problem to solve was already presenting itself.",
